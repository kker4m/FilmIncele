# React-Movie-Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a React Single Page App (SPA) that pulls movie data from the TMDB REST api and displays it. It uses components from the [Material-Ui](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) component library.

The app is deployed on https://flixtracker.live/. The app is supported by my [backend REST API](https://github.com/KevinXZX/React-Movie-Backend) to facilate user authentication and CRUD functionality on movie ratings.

The `master` branch contains the live code deployed while the `dev_branch` contains any code in development and is not guaranteed to work. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
